# Parkinson-disease-progression-prediction
## An applied deep learning project by Abdullahi Olapojoye, Akshay Kamoji, Midhun Thaduru and Swapnika Amancha

Parkinson's disease is a disabling brain disorder that affects movements, cognition, sleep, and other normal functions. The goal of this project is to predict MDS-UPDRS scores, which measure progression in patients with Parkinson's disease. The MDS-UPDRS is a comprehensive assessment of both motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease.

## MDS-UPDRS
Stands for Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). It is a standardized rating scale used to assess the motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). MDS-UPDRS is not a diagnostic test in itself but rather a tool that helps physicians and researchers evaluate the severity of PD symptoms. It is used to track disease progression, and monitor the response to treatment.

## Data Description
The dataset is collected for patients over at a frequency of 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. months. Each patient has dataset across.

**train_peptides.csv**: Mass spectrometry data at peptide level, including UniProt ID code, peptide sequence, and frequency of amino acid in sample.

**train_proteins.csv**: Protein expression frequencies aggregated from peptide level data, including UniProt ID code, normalized protein expression, and ID codes for visit and patient.

**train_clinical_data.csv**: Clinical data, including ID codes for visit and patient, UPDRS scores, and medication information.

**supplemental_clinical_data.csv**: Additional clinical data for context about progression of Parkinson's disease.
